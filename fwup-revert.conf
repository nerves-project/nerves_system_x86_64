# Revert firmware for x86_64
#
# To use:
#   1. Run `fwup -c -f fwup-revert.conf -o revert.fw` and copy revert.fw to
#      the device. This is done automatically as part of the Nerves system
#      build process. The file is stored in `/usr/share/fwup/revert.fw`.
#   2. On the device, run `fwup -t revert revert.fw -d $NERVES_FW_DEVPATH`. If
#      it succeeds, reboot. If not, then it's possible that there isn't a previous
#      firmware or the metadata about what's stored where is corrupt or out of
#      sync.
#
# It is critical that this is kept in sync with the main fwup.conf.

#  Run 'fwup -m' to query values in a .fw file.
#  Use 'fw_printenv' to query values on the target.

# These are used by Nerves libraries to introspect.
