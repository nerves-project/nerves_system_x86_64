# Changelog

This project does NOT follow semantic versioning. The version increases as
follows:

1. Major version updates are breaking updates to the build infrastructure.
   These should be very rare.
2. Minor version updates are made for every major Buildroot release. This
   may also include Erlang/OTP and Linux kernel updates. These are made four
   times a year shortly after the Buildroot releases.
3. Patch version updates are made for Buildroot minor releases, Erlang/OTP
   releases, and Linux kernel updates. They're also made to fix bugs and add
   features to the build infrastructure.

    issue where some optimizations could not be enabled in NIFs even though it
    should be possible to have them. E.g., ARM NEON support for CPUs that have
    it.

## v1.18.1

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.3)

## v1.18.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.11 and OTP 24.2. If you have made a
custom system, please review the `nerves_system_br` [release
notes](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/blob/v1.18.2/CHANGELOG.md#v1180).

* Updated dependencies

  * [Buildroot 2021.11](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-December/629911.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.2.README)
  * GCC 10.3

* Improvements
  * Support for the `dl.nerves-project.org` backup site. Due to a GitHub outage
    in November, there was a 2 day period of failing builds since some packages
    could not be downloaded. We implemented the backup site to prevent this in
    the future. This update is in the `nerves_defconfig`.
  * Use new build ORB on CircleCI. This ORB will shorten build times to fit in
    CircleCI's new free tier limits. Please update if building your own systems.

## v1.17.3

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.4)

  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.4](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.4.README).

## v1.17.1

This is a security/bug fix patch release. It should be safe to update for
everyone.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.1)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-October/625642.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.2.README)

* Improvements
  * Include software versioning and licensing info (see legal-info directory in
    artifact)

## v1.17.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.08 and OTP 24.1. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.17.0` release
notes.
* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-September/622072.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.README)

## v1.16.2

This release updates Erlang/OTP from 24.0.3 to 24.0.5 and Buildroot from 2021.05
to 2021.05.1. Both of these are security/bug fix updates. This is expected to be
a safe upgrade from v1.16.1 for all users.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.5](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.5.README)

* Improvements
  * Beta support for using a `runtime.exs` script for runtime configuration.
  * Added a `provision` task to the `fwup.config` to enable re-provisioning a
    MicroSD card without changing its contents.
  * Adds a default `/etc/sysctl.conf` that enables use of ICMP in Erlang. This
    requires `nerves_runtime v0.11.5` or later to automatically load the sysctl
    variables. With it using `:gen_udp` to send/receive ICMP will "just work".
    It also makes it easier to add other sysctl variables if needed.

## v1.16.1

This release updates Nerves Toolchains to v1.4.3 and OTP 24.0.3. It should be safe for everyone to apply.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.3](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.3.README)
  * [nerves toolchains v1.4.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.3)

## v1.16.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.05 and OTP 24.0.2. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.16.0` release
notes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.0)

  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.2.README)

* Improvements
  * This release now contains debug symbols and includes the Build-ID in the
    ELF headers. This makes it easier to get stack traces from C programs. As
    before, the Nerves tooling strips all symbols from firmware images, so this
    won't make programs bigger.

## v1.15.1

This is a security/bug fix release that updates to Buildroot 2021.02.1 and OTP
23.3.1. It should be safe for everyone to apply.

* Updated dependencies

## v1.14.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2020.11.2, GCC 10.2 and OTP 23.2.4.

When migrating custom systems based, please be aware of the following important
changes:

* The GCC 10.2.0 toolchain has a different name that calls out "nerves" as the
  vendor and the naming is now more consistent with other toolchain providers.
* Experimental support for tooling that requires more information about the
  target has been added. The initial support focuses on zigler.

* Fixes
  * Running images using the `run_qemu.sh` script works again. This is unsupported,
    but may be useful as a start for running images via qemu.

## v1.13.0

  * [nerves_heart v0.3.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_heart/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* New features
  * The `/data` directory now exists for storing application-specific data. It
    is currently a symlink to `/root`. Using `/data` will eventually be
    encouraged over `/root` even though currently there is no advantage. This
    change makes it possible to start migrating paths in applications and
    libraries.

* Fixes
  * Fixed old references to the `-Os` compiler flag. All C/C++ code will default
    to using `-O2` now.

## v1.12.1

## v1.4.0

This release contains various updates to provisioning variables and data.

**Host requirements**

Building firmware using this system requires `fwup` to be updated on your
host computer to at least `v1.2.5`. The target minimum version requirement
has not changed from `0.15.0`.

**Serial numbers**

Device serial numbers are now set using `NERVES_SERIAL_NUMBER` instead of
`SERIAL_NUMBER`. This is to reduce ambiguity on the source of the serial
by name spacing it along side other Nerves variables. The U-Boot environment
key has also changed from `serial_number` to `nerves_serial_number`. The
erlinit.config has been updated to provide backwards compatibility for setting
the hostname from the serial number by checking for `nerves_serial_number`
and falling back to `serial_number`.

**Custom provisioning**

Provisioning data is applied at the time of calling the `fwup` task `complete`.
The `complete` task is executed when writing the firmware to the target disk.
During this time, `fwup` will include the contents of a provisioning file
located at `${NERVES_SYSTEM}/images/fwup_include/provisioning.conf`. By default,
this file only sets `nerves_serial_number`. You can add additional provisioning
data by overriding the location of this file to include your own by setting
the environment variable `NERVES_PROVISIONING`. If you override this variable
you will be responsible for also setting `nerves_serial_number`.
